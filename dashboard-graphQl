This is often done using statistical techniques where one doesn’t have to explicitly program the systems to identify patterns, extract the learning from data and improve in the process. It was a term coined by artificial intelligence and computer gaming expert Arthur Samuel. Google Now, Apple’s Siri and Amazon Alexa, three of the most popular virtual assistants in use today are good examples where machine learning is playing a vital role in improving the quality of our lives. In this context, machine learning algorithms will collect data related to your previous interactions with the virtual assistant and use it to deliver results tailored to your preference.",

Location plays a vital role in the connected world we live in to help us make sense of the world around us. Whether we’re using it to track patterns and derive insights or simply, make our way around a city. As the use of mobile technology increases and we become more connected, more hyper-local data is available to create services and applications. From ride-sharing to targeted advertisements, new services and applications that leverage our mobile technology and location data are prevalent. With location and map data you can create solutions that better connect our growing cities and populations.",

This data, most of which is large volumes of unstructured data, when accurately interpreted can help organizations make informed business decisions. Big Data analytics is that process of analysing the large sets of data (structured and unstructured) to identify patterns and trends especially when it comes to predicting customer behaviour and reducing operational overheads. A data analytics professional need to typically deal with the 3 Vs of Big Data, i.e. Volume, Velocity, Veracity. Volume is the large chunk of data that is being churned out, Velocity is the speed at which this data is being generated and Veracity pertains to the validity of the data i.e. ensuring whether the data being collected is accurate as well as intended for the right purpose. Scope of Big Data in your Career Enterprises are increasingly investing in big data solutions in India. In fact, India has topped big data and analytics adoption in the APAC region as per a recent survey.",
